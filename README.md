# Odyseed - GGJ2023

An original game for Global Game Jam 2023, in which the design prompt was "roots".

## High Concept and Gameplay Loop

In this unconventional "platformer", you are a seed that cannot move itself, but instead must root itself to the ground and other objects in order to control how forces in the environment move you. Get pulled by gravity and blown around by wind, root to surfaces to control your path and make it to a planting pot, all while collecting nutrients along the way.
